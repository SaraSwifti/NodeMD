## Review
<<<<<<< HEAD
When I started this project, I felt like I had a good grasp of where to start. I felt like I was making great progress until I realized that the repository had not pulled down one file into a folder that had starter code in it for me (I still can't understand why just one file did not come in and decided to do another pull to solve the mystery of the empty folder). It was from there that I needed to start my approach to my modules from the start, causing me to loos valuable time in my progress of this program. I was able to meet all of the sucess criteria except for the licence badges and linking of the table of contents. I did enjoy this project and am looking forward to reviewing the solution to these elements so that I can continue to improve on this project and my coding ability.
